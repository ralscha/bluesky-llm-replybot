We need to make sure this gets split into multiple posts correctly. The splitting should respect 
word boundaries when possible, and each chunk should be properly marked with continuation indicators 
like (1/3), (2/3), etc. This way users will know they're reading a thread of connected messages. 
The implementation uses the uniseg library to properly count grapheme clusters, which is important 
because some characters that look like one character are actually multiple Unicode code points. 
Emojis like 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 are a good example of this - they're composed of multiple code points but should 
be counted as a single grapheme. This ensures we don't split in the middle of an emoji or other 
multi-codepoint grapheme cluster.`
